# BingoGame
A simple Bingo game that is made using WinForms frameworks. The game will display a new number when called via a button. The game cannot be started unless told by clicking the "Start" button. Furthermore, Bingo cannot be called unless all the numbers are already called. When a new number is called, it will display in a flexbox on the right hand side. When a button is clicked to select a number, the button changes color. Finally, when a bingo is won, the user can click the "Bingo!" to check if they have a true bingo. If yes, the application will congradulate them with a text box popup. Otherwise, it will inform them via a textbox popup that they do not have a bingo.
